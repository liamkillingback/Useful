This app is a simple windows program that lets the user add files or websites to a list that gets launched at once, and the preset is saved. 
includes a few quality of life functions such as the googleapiclient to fetch youtube titles as to replace the URL in the list with the actual title name for readability

can be modified for use on other OS as the directory search is specific to exe's.

# How to use:

Run the python code, a window will appear and will have 4 buttons. 

# Open file:
open file will open up a directory window where you will select a file to be added to the list

# Add web URL:
a pop up box will appear where you can enter a website, if the website is a youtube video, the video title will be added to the visual list instead of the directory.

# Run Apps:
will open up everything that you have added to the list. Files, exes and websites

# Clear Cache:
will clear file memory as to start a new list of programs/websites

notes:
-You will need to add your own API in order for the program to run, as it is used to fetch youtube titles. Otherwise you can delete the reletive functions if you do not want it

-will add two .txt files to where the app is located, as to save the directories and file names
